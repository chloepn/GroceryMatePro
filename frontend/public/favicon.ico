The favicon.ico file is typically a binary file that represents the icon displayed in the browser tab. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, I will provide a placeholder comment indicating that this file is intentionally left blank.

Here are the contents for the file:

/project-name/project-name/frontend/public/favicon.ico
